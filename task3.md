Differences between operators spread and rest, examples of their use:


Spread: Used in the context of expanding elements (arrays, objects, function arguments).
Rest: Used in the context of collecting elements into an array or object.


Usage:

Spread:
In function calls: myFunction(...args)
In array literals: [...array]
In object literals: {...object}

Rest:
In function parameters: function(...args) { }
In array destructuring: [a, b, ...rest]
In object destructuring: {a, b, ...rest}
